If my brain was fresh dirt
and pink worms electric thoughts.

I'd let some poke and dig around
for tiny pathways that may
eventually meet or split away.

I'd pinch out a larger few
that cause me pain
and maybe eat them so they'd pay.

I'd allow the lazy ones
to stay quiet like they were tame
hoping secretly from sleep they'd wake.

But sometimes I'd fear
my brain would disappear,
and the worms would rot
without a thought.
