Teleportation of words by shifty runes of circle!
My powers of art are not mimicry!

Chant with realism, said page 3:
Painted purple leaves with cyan tubercles,
Leaving their colors in spring water.
Crumbling away into yellow then brown freckles.

Magenta waves complement the burble of hectic mana water.
Leafy autumn-red gleaming spots dancing in mini tornados-
The sun reflecting off them with rainbows.

My learnings in alchemy have far taught me firmly,
Natural stirrings create a greater effect than artificial.

But what a lie- the drivel-
that I conjured this, by mind, with no basis of reality.
