Deja vu bores my brain
with how frequently mornings begin with dullness.
I’m paralyzed.

When I’m filled with stress,
The familiar scenery without novelty no longer calms.
The songs I sing are all the same as a decade ago.
The undecorated room I’ve stayed in since childhood is so small now.

I watch others pass by,
And I chase their dreams jealously
Yet find nothing greater than eventual muted instagram stories.
I’m paralyzed.
