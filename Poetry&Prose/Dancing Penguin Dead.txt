Now, dance with me.
In gray folds of hirsute penguins:
a wave of porcelain faith
in an overly patriotic sweater.

The only thing that breathes is me,
where the parachute sky but a concrete night
stood bursting with
storm clouds, sky, bursting in sea

sea, struggling to be free yet unable to be.
they scream "roll away the stone",
there is no reward and is so cold.
what station is the static on?

sea it in red letters
across my body a universe,
and one of them left me moaning-
a slow sigh-

sleep visited like a resentful friend.
