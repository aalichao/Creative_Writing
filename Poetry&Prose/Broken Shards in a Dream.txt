In our first greeting, I didn’t realize you weren’t whole.
But merely shards of beautiful pottery,
A sheer contrast to gray-stained jars painted so watery.

A few broken pieces made out a smile,
A single glance, so sweet as to make a person’s day––no, week!
Unseen was how your inside remained so bleak.

Is a person’s life defined through their years or months or days or hours?
No, it is seconds––art’s inspiration and ruin occur so suddenly.

Inside of vases remained flowers wilting for months;
Inside of friends remained thoughts for years, crumbling us slowly.

Seen here are fake colorless tears on gray porcelain faces,
Unseen are the colors of your shards in my broken heart.

Several colors appear on my previously lonely face,
Guided by your beauty and unfinished art.

A tiny crack in my chest remains,
And again the cracking restarts.
