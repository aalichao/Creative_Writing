If the heart beats a thousand times,
Poets would have a thousand words to say,
And a thousand girls to see eye to eyes.

If they only talk about one with rhymes,
It’s time to say:
Make a move or you’re wasting your times.

Or maybe you’re overthinking love with your brain,
A heart truly only beats
And is simpler than you’d think

If you only ever talk about hearts-
But not futures.
Kisses and Looks-
But no hugs nor tears.

You’re using your brain too much
for love that may,
like the hearts you too often reference,
stop beating one day.

So don’t love smartly,
Love dumbly.

Make a move instead of writing,
Or you’ll be alone while crying
