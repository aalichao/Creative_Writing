In youth,
My playful footprints left wet painted prints
with the sound of laughter
upon a canvas filled with hopscotch chalk.

In maturity,
My tires leave oily stains
with the mundane days
upon freshly paved roads that leave headaches.

As a child I thought I could live here forever,
As an adult I think I will regret dying here.
